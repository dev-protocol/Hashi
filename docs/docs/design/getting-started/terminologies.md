Before we discuss the individual foundational principles of Hashi, we must first dissect how we are going to identify things from here on out.

| Term    | Definition                                                                                                                            |

| Token   | It is a key-value pair of carefully crafted design values. In other design systems, this is usually identified as *design variables*. |
| Content | It is anything the user can consume in a page.                                                                                        |
| Surface | It is the area all elements operate on. Surfaces can be found in components, or in the back of pages.                                 |
| Key     | It is a parameter that uses a token as its value, or another key.                                                                     |
